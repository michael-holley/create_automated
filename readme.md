HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT:
These instuctions are for linux machines. Not sure how to make this work on windows since I haven't done this on windows. I will update the instructions once I know.

1. Download the bash script
2. Navigate to location of the bash script via terminal
3. Type the following commands:
	
	-chmod +x create
	
	-sudo cp /usr/bin
	
4. Navigate to the location you want to create a repository
5. Use your new command "create" to run the script.


This is a project that I am going to built to help with my workflow. As my workflow changes, this script will change as well.

When I get ready to start a new project, I do the same things every time. I create a repository on my machine, I use git init, create a readme.md file (and add a simple explanation to it)
and the source code file that I am going to start with. This makes a single command that does all of those things for me so I can jump into coding it that much faster.

The one thing that I would like to do, but am not sure that I can is allow github as a remote repo for the local repo since there is the new tokens that we have to add to the config files.
Not sure how I would go about coding for that, but for now I am going to start with the other features since those are my primary moves. Not everything I code goes to github since a lot of
my projects are small one or two line automations for personal use.
